## ArcGIS for Canadian Municipalities - Polling Place Locator 10.2

The Polling Place Locator helps voters find their polling place location, obtain driving directions, comment on the polling place and get information about their candidates.

This ArcGIS JavaScript API application is highly configurable and works with the [Canadian Municipal Data Model](http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=0487111bd16a4c2ca757687d588aa783 "Download the Data Model"). It can be deployed and used on desktop, smartphones or tablet devices.

The voter can switch between regular (default) and advanced polling places.  There is also a print option to get a hard copy of the map, driving directions and the polling place details.
