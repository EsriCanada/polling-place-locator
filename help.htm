	    <p>To begin, a voter enters their address, selects a point on the map, or uses their current position.  The application will then find the assigned polling place and highlight it along with the polling division area.  The route from the search address or point to the polling place will also be displayed. In addition, information about that polling place and candidates will be displayed in tabs at the bottom of the application.</p>
		<hr>
		<h4>Regular (Election Day) or Advanced Polls Selection</h4>
		<p>The application starts with Regular (voting day) polling places selected.  The voter can locate advanced polls by selecting the Display Advanced Polls icon.  The voter can switch back to regular polls by selecting the same icon.</p>
